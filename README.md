Our web app allows users to input a block of text and it will change adjectives to synonyms of themselves. We have a basic algorithm that introduces guarenteed variety of synonyms and a similarity score that ensures there is a working synonym that matches the original words definition/context. You shouldn't be getting random meaningless related words, but versatile replacements that keep the original meaning of your text!
